## 🔬 **Research and Projects**  

- **Accelerating Recommendation Systems**  
  [M.Tech Thesis | Ongoing | Advisor: Prof. R. Govindarajan]  
  Reducing embedding table sizes by 80% with hash embeddings and efficient representations without compromising accuracy.  

- **Low-Resource Language Translation**  
  Fine-tuned **LLaMA, Mistral**, and others using **PEFT** and **LoRA**, achieving a BLEU score improvement of 4 points with limited data.  

- **Seq2Seq Transliteration for Indian Names**  
  Built an RNN-based encoder-decoder model with attention, achieving **BLEU: 0.8569** and reducing token error rates significantly.  

- **Community Detection**  
  Implemented algorithms like **Louvain** and **Girvan-Newman** on real-world datasets, achieving modularity-based detection of communities.
