### 👋 About Me

Hi! I’m **Chinmay Jain**, a passionate researcher and engineer currently pursuing my **M.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering** at the **Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore**. With a strong foundation in Electrical Engineering and professional experience at **Deloitte India**, I have cultivated a unique blend of analytical thinking and hands-on technical expertise.

My academic journey has led me to specialize in **Machine Learning**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and **High-Performance Computing**, where I explore innovative solutions to complex problems. I am particularly focused on optimizing **recommendation systems** by eliminating traditional embedding tables and leveraging advanced hashing techniques to achieve significant memory and computational efficiency without compromising accuracy.

I’m deeply motivated by the challenge of bridging the gap between theoretical insights and real-world applications. Whether it's developing models to improve linguistic accessibility, enhancing the computational performance of AI systems, or building autonomous robotics solutions, I strive to make a meaningful impact in the field of technology.

 When I’m not immersed in research or coding, you’ll often find me sharpening my skills in chess, hitting the badminton court or watching anime. I believe in the power of interdisciplinary growth and the importance of combining creativity with technical rigor to solve problems effectively.
